--8<-- "_snippets/privacy-security/contacts.md"

### Employment checks

n8n performs employment checks on all new hires.

### Workstation security

n8n provides hardware to all new hires. These machines run a local agent that sets configuration of the operating system to hardened standards, including:

- Automatic OS updates
- Hard disk encryption
- Anti-malware software
- Screen lock


### System access

n8n grants employees access to systems on a least-privilege basis. This means that employees only have access to the data they need to perform their job. The company reviews system access quarterly, on any change in role, and upon termination.

### Security training

Employees receive privacy and security training during onboarding as well as on an ongoing basis. n8n requires all employees to read and sign n8n's comprehensive information security policy covering the security, availability, and confidentiality of n8n services.
